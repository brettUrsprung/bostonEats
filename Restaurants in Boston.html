    <p class="big-text">This list, while not comprehensive is a wonderful starting point for some of <br>
        the more delicious eateries within the city limits.<br>
        Each location here is quite unique and focuses on a different cuisine.<br>
         They are all somewhat fancy, yes, but to enjoy<br>
        eating at locations such as this means you will more thoroughly enjoy the food, the <br>
        experience, and the company.. Even if it means you won't be able to eat out again <br>
        for the rest of the month. Budgeting, budgeting, budgeting. <br>
